/**
 * Utility class for safely constructing {@link CloseReason} instances.
 * <p>
 * The standard {@link CloseReason} constructor enforces a maximum length
 * of 123 bytes for the UTF-8 encoded reason phrase. If the provided string
 * exceeds this limit, the constructor throws an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This utility ensures that you always get a valid {@code CloseReason}:
 * it will truncate the reason text at a character boundary such that
 * the UTF-8 encoding is guaranteed to be ≤ 123 bytes, and then construct
 * the {@code CloseReason}. This avoids runtime exceptions due to overly
 * long reason phrases (yes, it can happen easily if you don't pay attention).
