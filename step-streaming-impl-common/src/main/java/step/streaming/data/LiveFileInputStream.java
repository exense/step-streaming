/**
 * An {@link java.io.InputStream} implementation that reads from a file which may still be growing.
 * <p>
 * Unlike a standard {@link java.io.FileInputStream}, this stream does not return EOF (end-of-file)
 * immediately upon reaching the current end of the file. Instead, it waits until the associated
 * {@link EndOfInputSignal} indicates that the file is fully written and no more data will arrive.
 * In other words, it will continue to block, waiting for the file to grow,
 * and only signal EOF when both the end of the file was reached, and
 * the given finishedSignal indicates success. If the finishedSignal indicates
 * an error, an IOException is thrown instead.
 * <p>
 * This is useful for streaming scenarios where data is being written to a file while it is being read,
 * such as in live uploads or log tailing use cases.
